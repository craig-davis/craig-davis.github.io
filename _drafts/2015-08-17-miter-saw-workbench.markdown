  - title: The Plan
    img: /img/posts/miter-saw-workbench/IMG_0145.jpg
    caption: The design and cut plan
    instruction: |
        This is the basic design and important measurements. Your measurements will be different based on the saw. The runner height + your saw deck gives you the height from the top of the bottom platform surface to the top of the work surface. Be careful to measure your plywood! This was built from maple ply that was actually &frac34;. Many plywoods measure between a sixteenth and a thirty-second under. When in doubt, make the box a little tall and then shim the saw upwards.
  - title: Dry fit to check for saw height and width
    img: /img/posts/miter-saw-workbench/IMG_0141.jpg
    caption: Assembled without joinery and held with clamps.
    instruction: This is a dry fit of all the parts to check for height and sizes. Note that with the runners in place, you cannot place the internal ribs. In the plans, there is a 1" overhang of the top work surfaces. This allows the opening for the top of the saw to be fine tuned. At this stage, you can do the initial tuning of this, and in the final step you can do the final fitting of the saw into it's new home.
  - title: Runners for strength
    img: /img/posts/miter-saw-workbench/IMG_0146.jpg
    caption: The platform with runners in place
    instruction: This is where the rigidity of the workbench comes from. This prevents the two end boxes from flexing the center open space. The runners are secured with glue and pocket screws. Be certain that they are cut to length to allow a rib to be placed on each end. The internal ribs will have slots cut into them for the runners, the end ribs should be full. This means that the runners are cut to the length of the platform less twice the thickness of your plywood.
  - title: Cutting the holes

    caption: A 2&frac14;" hole saw to cut the openings for the box
    instruction: |
        A hole saw makes it easy to make the new openings in the box. The plans use five matching ribs, and it's best to [make a template](/img/posts/miter-saw-workbench/IMG_0336.jpg) so that they all match.
  - title: Creating the long face plates
    img: /img/posts/miter-saw-workbench/IMG_0341.jpg
    caption: These long plates are still quite strong
    instruction: |
        Use a jig saw to connect the two hole saw cuts together. You can see the cutouts on the ground in ths photo. Take your time and draw a line connecting tangent to the two holes that you've cut. It will help you cut a straight line with the jigsaw.
  - title: Sanding, lots of sanding
    img: /img/posts/miter-saw-workbench/IMG_0343.jpg
    caption: Sanding will prevent splinters later in life!
    instruction:
        I used a 1&frac12;" PVC pipe to help to the sanding. The outside diameter is about 2" and so this was perfect for these holes. One day I'll have a oscillating spindle sander, but for now&hellip; In addition to sanding the cuts smooth, I eased the edges of the plywood quite a bit. The holes will be used to pickup and move this around and it'll make it easier on your hands.
  - title: Pocket Hole Joinery
    img: /img/posts/miter-saw-workbench/IMG_0346.jpg
    caption: Pre-drilling all the joinery will save lots of time
    instruction:
        The ribs each get four pocket holes to attach them to the front and rear plates. These can all be drilled before assembly. Remember to drill them on the uglier side of the plywood. You can see some plywood tearout in this photo that will be hidden after assembly.

Inspired by the [Paulk Workbenches][paulk], I built a new miter saw station from scrap plywood from a previous project. I had to 18" x 8 foot sections of &frac34;" Maple Plywood and I created plans to use this efficiently. As a result, you could build this from a single sheet of plywood.

I created this using a [Kreg RipCut Jig][ripcut], and the cut plan that I generated reflects this. With this jig instead of a tablesaw, it's best to nibble away from the large sheet instead of breaking it down initially. If you have access to a tablesaw, then I might suggest he Paulk plans. They look quite nice.

The structure is made rigid by two runners that run the entire length of the platform board, and the sides and ribs are cut to the correct height for the saw so that the deck of the saw is flush with the working surfaces. The joinery is glue and [Kreg Pocket Screws][pocket].
