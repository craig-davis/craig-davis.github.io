This winter I've had three friends ask me "Hey, I want to mountain bike, what bike should I buy? What else should I buy?". This article is a collection of questions and answers. I'll include a few links to things (Some are Amazon Affiliate links).

These are my honest opions about gear that I ride with and that I personally know. I won't recommend anything that I don't have experience with.

I believe that the outdoor industry has somehow decided that every new sport you adopt will cost $2k. If you want to ski, $2k. If you want to climb, $2k. If you want to bike, $2k. The list of bike + accessories in this article will be about $2k.

## Buy Local

There is a huge difference in quality between a $800 bike and a $1400 bike. For your first bike, you want to be at the less expensive end of the bikes sold by your *local bike shop*. Buy from a local shop, they'll be your guide, source of local knowledge, and center of your new community.

Buying local helps keep the local bike scene alive and funded. Please don't order bikes online. When you buy your first bike from them they'll assemble it themselves with love and care. When you pick it up, bring them a six pack of a local beer. Give it to them in a brown paper bag. Tell them thank you, and that they should keep it refridgerated. This is tradition.

## Bike Selection

You want good components and a nice bike. I think your first bike should be a hardtail. A hardtail is a bike that has a rigid rear and suspension only for the front wheel. By getting a hardtail instead of a full suspension bike you'll get nicer bike components for the same price point and you'll get a bike that forces you to learn some fundamental skills correctly.

In 2019, there's lots of bike styles - but the right one to start with is a Hardtail Trail bike. Trail bikes tend to be playful and easy to ride bikes with good manners for riding over obstactles and handling technical terrain. In the Pacific Northwest, our wet and rooty year round riding means that having a larger tire is nice too. A 27.5+ (27.5 plus) tire is a great choice. This tire is a newer standard, and it's a little larger in diameter than a traditional mountain bike wheel and the tire on it is a fair bit wider. This also means that the tire can be a little softer and help make up for the fact that you'll be starting out without any rear suspension.

The 27.5+ Hardtail Trail Bike category has some great bikes in it. If you have the opportunity, ride each of them and see if one of them speaks to you. You might be surprised that one of them just feels more natural to you. Each of these bikes can be purchased at several price points. For the most part each of the levels has exactly the same frame and each level up has slightly nicer components. This means that the shifters, brakes, and wheels get nicer as you pay more. Once you cross the line around $1400 the initial performance of all of the components is pretty similar. The nicer components will be lighter and more durable, but you might not notice a lot of difference on day one.
