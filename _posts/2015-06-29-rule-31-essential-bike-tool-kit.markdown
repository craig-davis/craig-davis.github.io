## The Essential Bike Tool Kit

I carry more tools than most, but this is it. This is the ultimate bike tool kit. After years of experimenting, flatting, and fiddling with tools, I've found this to be the stripped down and simplest single jersey pocket toolkit that can address almost any issue.

Here's the kit when assembled and ready to ride:

This kit has the essentials for tire repair, common bike issues, and a couple extra bits for weirder roadside emergencies. My goal is make sure that this can still fit in a single jersey pocket. I ride with this in the middle pocket, my phone and a credit card and a spare tube in my left pocket, and my food in my right pocket.

## Rule 31

[Rule 31](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#31): Spare tubes, multi-tools and repair kits should be stored in jersey pockets.

Don't have a floppy dangly bag under your saddle. Build this tool kit and keep it with you. Toss it in your messenger bag for riding a townie to work, keep it in your Camelbak for mountain bike rides, or in your center jersey pocket for road and cross rides.

Go Ride!
