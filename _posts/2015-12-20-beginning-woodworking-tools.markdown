I grew up in my grandfathers woodworking shop, and have worked with tools my whole life. I don't have my own shop yet, and so I've collected just enough tools for projects over the last 15 years that fit into a couple of bins. This collection of tools will give you the basic tools for DIY projects and furniture. With this set of tools you'll only be limited by your imagination.

## Safety

First and foremost, protect yourself. Long term exposure to chemicals, loud noises, and short term exposure to sharp tools can cause a lot of damage. Be safe!

And as an aside, when you've got new tools - practice your cuts once with the tool off and really look at your fingers, elbows, and other body parts that are near cutting edges. Getting used to how your tools and move is critical!

<dl>
    <dt>Safety glasses</dt>
    <dd>ER doctors are remarkably good at removing splinters from your eyeballs, but safety glass really are a lot cheaper. Find a set that fits close to your face, particularly your cheeks to prevent anything from bouncing upwards and underneath your glasses.</dd>

    <dt>Ear plugs and Ear protection</dt>
    <dd>Tools are loud and <strong>will</strong> cause permanent damage. Ear plugs offer better protection, but can be a hassle if you're working with other people. Purchase both, and for really loud projects, use both together!</dd>

    <dt>N99 Dust mask</dt>
    <dd>Buy the good ones with the vents to exhale. Dust can carry any number of bad things, and N99 masks will offer some protection from welding, soldering, and paint fumes as well. Please always remember that plywood and engineered wood products have a wide variety of glues and bonding chemicals in them that are bad news for your lungs, and always wear a mask and when sanding and applying finishes.</dd>
</dl>

## Cleaning

A clean and organized working area is a safe area. I keep a brush handy to clean as I go. Buy a box of rags &emdash; they'll be great to have around when you're working on finishing projects.

<dl>
    <dt>Dust brush and pan</dt>
    <dd>A small brush you can keep on your workbench</dd>

    <dt>Rags</dt>
    <dd>A cheap box of rags will help in cleaning and will always be useful!</dd>

    <dt>Hand Soap</dt>
    <dd>Borax and GoJo are my favorite hand soaps. Borax is old, and to me smells like my Grandfathers shop.</dd>
</dl>

## Measuring

Measure twice, cut once. Even better, learn to never measure - but that's another post!

<dl>
    <dt>Mechanical pencil</dt>
    <dd>Carpenters pencils are for carpentry, not for detailed projects. If you're doing trim work or building furniture then a mechanical pencil is superior. It'll have much better repeatability.</dd>

    <dt>Combination square</dt>
    <dd>An accurate combination square is essential for getting good results. Learn to use it! You'll be able to mark corners, find centerlines, gage the depth of things, make right angle lines. There are a lot of ways to use this tool.</dd>

    <dt>Sliding bevel</dt>
    <dd>Remember how I mentioned it's best if you can never measure? This is one of the tools that helps with that. As often as possible take measurements from the actual angles and lengths of things instead of measuring. For instance, if you've made a cut at some angle, and now you need to make the opposite/complimentary cut, just use the gauge to measure the angle and then flip the gauge over. There's no need to bring numbers into the process.</dd>

    <dt>Measuring tape</dt>
    <dd>A good measuring tape is critical. Take a little time to learn to use it. I prefer one with fractions measured on it.</dd>

    <dt>Folding rule</dt>
    <dd>A folding rule isn't as essential, but for repair projects it can be super useful. In particular they are a great way to measure the exact inside dimensions of something. This can often be hard to do with a regular tape measure.</dd>
</dl>

## Hand tools

This is a basic set of hand tools. These aren't all used directly, but may be useful in adjusting tools, dealing with miscellaneous fasteners, and other DIY projects.

<dl>
    <dt>Rubber mallet</dt>
    <dd>A non-marking source of motivation. Useful for knocking together glue ups, or taking apart dry fit pieces. Oh, and sealing paint cans, but keep it clean!</dd>

    <dt>Hammer</dt>
    <dd>A sixteen ounce claw hammer is the right place to start. A simple fiberglass handle will do.</dd>

    <dt>Screwdrivers</dt>
    <dd>Get an assortment of screwdrivers. Buy good screwdrivers, the higher quality metal won't round as many screws and you'll have better results.</dd>

    <dt>Paint can opener</dt>
    <dd>This is very different than a screwdriver! They are cheap and will extend the life of your favorite standard screwdriver.</dd>

    <dt>Razor knife</dt>
    <dd>A sharp knife is a safe knife. A sharp knife needs less </dd>

    <dt>Slip-joint pliers</dt>
    <dd>Please, don't use these on nuts or bolts.</dd>

    <dt>Needle-nose pliers</dt>
    <dd>Useful for everything from driving a heavy duty needle or fishing hook to dealing with small fasteners.</dd>

    <dt>Diagonal cutters</dt>
    <dd>Wire cutters that are also useful for zip ties, wire ties, and home electrical work</dd>

    <dt>Adjustable wrench</dt>
    <dd>You wouldn't think it, but there's a correct direction to use an adjustable wrench. Always use it so that it's turning towards the movable jaw. This keeps the movable jaw being forced towards the wrench body, and you won't strip as many bolt heads. But again, this is a tool of convenience - if you've got the socket or end wrench in your toolbox, use it.</dd>
</dl>

## Cutting

Saws. There's four basic saws that are worth having. Others will debate that there are far more. Actually, make that 7 - no. Well, start with these four.

<dl>
    <dt>Crosscut saw (12 pt.)</dt>
    <dd>A twelve point per inch crosscut saw is great for quickly trimming 2x4s and other lumber</dd>

    <dt>Rip saw (6 1/2 or 7 1/2 pt.)</dt>
    <dd>This is a saw used to cut with the direction of the wood grain. The teeth are set at a different angle, and while you can rip with a crosscut saw, it's worth having both. The teeth are cut to act more like a chisel, and so won't hunt around and follow grain the way that a crosscut saw would. You'll get straighter cuts.</dd>

    <dt>Japanese backsaw</dt>
    <dd>A dozuki is a saw that cuts on the pull stroke and has a stiffened blade. It's ideal for hand cut dovetails and other finishing work. A flexible backsaw is great for flush trimming.</dd>

    <dt>Hacksaw</dt>
    <dd>At some point, you're going to have to cut a bolt to length or some bar stock for a project. This is the tool for that.</dd>
</dl>

## Shaping

Wood and metal shaping tools. These will let you remove material efficiently.

<dl>
    <dt>Brad-point drill bits</dt>
    <dd>The go-to drill bit for wood. An assortment of these is a must. Keep them sharp, don't overheat them, and don't leave them to rattle around in a toolbox. They get dull that way. As you add more, learn about split points and rake angles for various materials.</dd>

    <dt>Spade drill bits</dt>
    <dd>Large and flat, these cut large holes when you don't care about the roundness of the hole or the finish. Home electrical wiring and making some large holes are the name here. For anything else, you'll want to start investing in Forstner bits and then hole saws for large sized holes.</dd>

    <dt>Bench planes</dt>
    <dd>A smoothing plane and a small block plane can be used to deal with a door that has swelled, a drawer that doesn't fit, and can be used to flatten and square all manner of boards.</dd>

    <dt>Wood chisels</dt>
    <dd>An assortment of wood chisels from 1/4" to 1" will be helpful. They'll be useful in everything from mortising for a door to making tenons to cleaning up dovetails. Don't use them for anything else - no scraping and no paint can opening! (We have a tool for that!)</dd>

    <dt>File</dt>
    <dd>A few files will be really handy, a small triangular file for detail work, and a few mill files will be great for everything from sharpening a lawnmower blade to deburring a bolt that you trimmed with your hacksaw.</dd>
</dl>

## Kreg Jigs

These will change the way that you view quick projects. The Kreg Pockethole jig allows you to quickly and easily join two piece of wood at a 90 or 180 degree angle. This can make face frames and basic box construction go quicker than you could ever imagine. It'll never be as pretty as fancy joints, but without a table saw, this will open up an entire new set of projects.

<dl>
    <dt>Simple kit</dt>
    <dd>The two hole or even the mini jig are a great place to start</dd>

    <dt>Regular clamp</dt>
    <dd>Most kits come with a flat clamp, but if not, this an absolute requirement. It allows you to hold the jig in position, and face frames flat as you add the screw.</dd>

    <dt>90 degree clamp</dt>
    <dd>Go ahead and get one, you'll like having it. It makes holding two board at 90 degrees really easy, and make box and drawer construction go quickly.</dd>

    <dt>Saw jig</dt>
    <dd>The circular saw jig will get you over the blues of not having a table saw. I use mine a lot. However, it requires that you think about teh cut plan for the project very differently. If you're cutting plywood, you'll want to nibble away at it instead of breaking it down into smaller pieces.</dd>
</dl>

## Clamps

You can never have too many. Stock up when there is a sale, and scrounge estate sales and Craigslist for more. You can start with spring

<dl>
    <dt>Spring Clamps</dt>
    <dd>Cheap and simple, these are great for laminating boards and small glue-ups.</dd>

    <dt>Simple Clamps</dt>
    <dd>Two foot bar clamps, with the trigger are great for holding smaller workpieces.</dd>

    <dt>Pipe clamps</dt>
    <dd>Cheap and durable, a set of four 5' bar clamps will help with larger projects. A simple bed headboard for instance.</dd>
</dl>

## Power Tools

Saw, drill, jigsaw will take you far. A sander is included with the finishing tools.

<dl>
    <dt>Drill</dt>
    <dd>A high quality drill is an absolute must. An 18 volt drill will have more than enough power to drive larger bits.</dd>

    <dt>Impact driver</dt>
    <dd>This is an optional tool, but if you're driving a lot of screws, installing a deck, or a lot of drywall, then an impact driver is a brilliant tool to own. They don't strip screws and can make short work of things.</dd>

    <dt>Jig Saw</dt>
    <dd>Go ahead and spend a little more on a nice one. This is a tool that will bridge the gap from now until you have a bandsaw, and will always be a great tool for odd jobs.</dd>

    <dt>Circular saw</dt>
    <dd>A 7 1/4 inch saw is a carpentry must. A worm drive is a great tool if you're framing, but can be heavy and a little hard to deal with if you plan to use it with a Kreg jig or a cutting guide.</dd>

    <dt>Router (1 hp, 1/4" collet) Purchase bits as needed; bead, chamfer, cove, straight, round-over, rabbet.</dt>
    <dd>A 1/4" collet will hold most of the bits you'll want for rabbetting drawers and frames. Purchase the bits as you need them, but you can start with a roundover and a flush cutting bit. You can clean up a lot of backyard building inaccuracy with a flush cutting bit.</dd>
</dl>


## Sanding and Finishing

<dl>
    <dt>Random orbit sander</dt>
    <dd>A five inch sander is a great start. The difference in a nice piece and a hack job is the quality of the finish. A nice sander will help that.</dd>

    <dt>Belt sander</dt>
    <dd>A second tier tool, but great to have.</dd>

    <dt>Assorted sandpaper</dt>
