  - title: "Chaos: Making a New Science"
    author: James Gleick
    year: 1987 and revised 2011

    amazon: http://amzn.to/1RlTGyy
    caption: Introducing the Butterfly Effect without heavy math.
    review: |
        <p>This book spurred my interest in scientific research in the ninth grade. I build a Lorenzian waterwheel with a charting system built from Lego. I used it to try to chart the transition of stable to chaotic behavior in the system. This book is relatable and fascinating in it's approach to explaining the field of chaos theory.</p><p>I can remember having a moment when I finally understood the behavior of Newtonian root finding, explained simply and clearly. However, the book is not entirely technical, and it introduces some of the people that were central to creating this important field of research. Chaos is deep, intriguing, and worth investigating.</p>
  - title: "The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography Paperback"
    author: Simon Singh
    year: 2000
    img: code-book.jpg
    amazon: http://amzn.to/1UQaD6B
    caption: A history of encryption in historical context
    review: |
        Secrecy has been important throughout history. This book traces the history of secret code as a method for secure communication. This book covers the entire history of code, including interesting topics on Mary, Queen of Scots, the Navajo Code Talkers, and the modern use of encryption in the internet. This book works to show the impact that cryptography has had on history, and how important it will be in the future. This book is very entertaining and interesting. It's perhaps a little short on some details, but as a popular science book, it is very casually readable.
  - title: "Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem"
    author: Simon Singh
    year: 1998
    img: fermats-enigma.jpg
    amazon: http://amzn.to/1SdQH7s
    caption: A surprisingly emotional story of mathematics
    review: |
        Another from Singh, this book studies the history of the pursuit of the last theorem of Pierre de Fermat. He posed a simple mathematical equation that remained unsolved for 350 years. I hesitate to call this a page-turner, for after all, it is a math book - but... the historical detail, the fascinating characters, and sometimes deeply emotional turmoil of those who spent their lives in devotion to this knowlege is compelling reading. Singh delivers a detailed history of the problem, a quick history of mathematics, and one man's work to push the boundaries to solve this problem. It's a captivating tale.
  - title: "Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea"
    author: Charles Seife
    year: 2000
    img: zero.jpg
    amazon: http://amzn.to/21MAQ55
    caption: A history of infinity's twin
    review: |
        There are several books written about the history of zero, and this may be the least serious of the group. At times, it's a little too humorous and light. But, it does offer an interesting history of our struggle to address the concept of Zero - the one location on the number line that makes division explode and our head sometimes hurt from conflicting expectation. While the book is not without it's flaws in it's approach to calculus and to some extent all of Newtonian and classical mechanics, the overall history lessons in the book, and its approachable nature, make it an appealing book to read one day on vacation.

I've collected some of my favorite non-fiction books. Most of these are popular science books that present some topic in a presentable way that make them ideal for casual reading. None of these books need note-taking, and none of them are meant to be definitive texts on any subject. Many of these I read in high school, and many of them were very influential to me personally. All of them are books that I've recommended to friends in the past - so consider this a thumbs-up for the entire list.


If you do read any of these, drop me a note and let me know if you enjoyed them! You can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/There4Dev">@there4dev</a>
