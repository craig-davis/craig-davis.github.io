## The Ratio
* 2 parts Reposado Tequila
* 1 part Triple Sec
* &frac12; to &frac34; part Simple Syrup
* &frac34; part Fresh Squeezed Lime Juice
* &frac34; part Corona Beer

## The Tequila
I use Jose Cuervo Gold. It's a blend of Reposado and other tequilas. I think that it's great in a pitcher of Margaritas, with reasonable cost and a nice bite that works well with the salted glass rim, tart lime, and simple syrup sweetness.

## The Salt
* Take a small flat plate and cover it in Kosher Salt<sup>*</sup>.
* Zest part of a lime into it and stir or shake to distribute.
* Take a slice of lime, and run it around the edge of your glass.
* Dip into the salt until lightly covered
* Set aside to dry

_<strong>*</strong> Maldon Sea Salt is preferred - the lighter crystals really do make a diffence. I buy mine [at Amazon](http://amzn.to/2aqYBxZ)._

## The Process
Make the simple syrup by combining &frac34; cup white sugar with &frac34; cup of boiling water. I use my tea kettle to boil the water. Stir well until it turns almost clear. Note: This will make more than needed!

You'll need to juice a couple of pounds of limes - maybe 10 limes per cup of lime juice. I really like [this lemon juicer from Amazon](http://amzn.to/2aoci2o). Remember to roll the lime on your cutting board to loosen them up - it'll make a difference in how much juice you get from each.

Start with only &frac12; part Simple Syrup, and then add all of the ingredients except for the beer to a pitcher and give it a swirl. Adjust the sweetness by adding additional simple syrup, swirl it again, and then gently add the Corona. Give it a stir with a spoon. Add ice to the glasses, and pour.

## The Theory
I believe that the Margarita is really a mixed drink. Mixed drinks by the pitcher are too much for an afternoon with burgers and a sunny back porch. The lime and simple syrup give this a nice balance, and the Corona Beer adds some volume to the recipe, a little fizz, and drops the overall booziness of this recipe a little.

Enjoy!
