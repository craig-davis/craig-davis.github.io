## My Adventure Toolkit for my Yamaha WR250R

This is a small toolkit for my [WR250R](https://www.yamahamotorsports.com/dual-sport/models/wr250r)
that I carry on all of my rides. I started this kit by replacing the factory
tools and then adding tire care and simple emergency repair tools to the kit.
I've made sure that it covers most maintenance items as well.

In fact, you should use these tools to perform maintenance to make sure that
you've got what you need and that you know how to use these tools before you
have to use them in the middle of the desert.

In particular, this set has a smaller set of tire levers and a
[bead buddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir_Xo-g2dnQ). You should practice
changing a tube out with this set to make sure you can do it with
[your tires](http://wr250r.com/articles/tire-guide).

I've done my best to keep this small and trim. The photo above is taken with the
kit next to my favorite [summertime riding gloves](http://amzn.to/2ySNDg9). I'll
go through the tools in it and why I like them. You'll recognize that it uses
the large size mesh bag that came with the one that use for my
[bike tool kit](/2015/06/29/rule-31-essential-bike-tool-kit).

### The Contents of my WR250R Tool Kit

* __[Mesh Storage Bag](http://amzn.to/2iFJFUm)__<br>
  I like mesh bags because they don't hold water and you can see your
  tools easily through them. They aren't as durable as they could be, but they
  are cheap enough to occasionally replace.
* __[Patch Kit](http://amzn.to/2gKcryI)__ with __[Scabs](http://amzn.to/2gJOmIx)__<br>
  I carry both glue patches and quick adhesive patches. A thorn puncture close
  to home might be a simple adhesive patch. A torn tube might need a glue up.
  The glue patches take a little longer to do, but I do consider them
  permanent fixes.
* __[J-B Weld Steel Stick](http://amzn.to/2y9WWvg)__<br>
  This is a steel reinforced epoxy that you can hand mix. It sets in five
  minutes and can be machined after an hour. This can be a lifesaver for tasks
  like patching a oil cover. On big rides I also carry traditional JB Weld,
  the liquid can work well for hard to reach areas and tighter crevices.
* __[Spoke Wrench](http://amzn.to/2hgRTyD)__<br>
  This is a cheap spoke wrench that I haven't needed often. You can make
  do with an adjustable wrench, but having a proper wrench is cheap insurance
  for dealing with a wobbly spoke on a bent rim.
* __[4" Adjustable Wrench](http://amzn.to/2i9XAOv)__<br>
  Surprisingly versatile, this little wrench can open to half an inch and
  can be very useful when working on your friends bike if they don't have their
  tookit with them.
* __[5" Vise Grips with wire cutter](http://amzn.to/2gIJL9r)__<br>
  These can be used for everything from gripping a broken clutch cable to
  holding broken parts together while your JB Weld cures.
* __[0.021 Safety Wire](http://amzn.to/2hgQ8BA)__<br>
  If it can't be fixed with JB Weld and Bailing wire, you've really broken it.
  Great for holding on broken exhaust or loose plastics, this wire is thin
  enough that you can easily stitch parts together with it or wrap things up
  and bind them. Use the cutters on the vise grips to cut it.
* __[Pencil flashlight](http://amzn.to/2iaHBzE)__<br>
  I keep a headlamp in my riding pack, but I keep a dedicated light in this
  little bag to make sure that I am never without. The shape can be nice for
  getting into tight corners. Even in the daytime it can be hard to see into
  nooks and crannies of a bike if you're parked in the shade.
* __[Bic Lighter](http://amzn.to/2xvj8M4)__<br>
  This is more likely a survival item, but I have dealt with frayed saddlebag
  straps with it.
* __[Tire Pressure Gauge](http://amzn.to/2gJMQpP)__<br>
  After dealing with a flat, this is a key item. Ideally for long rides you
  could carry a more accurate dial gauge, but for a quick fix this will do
  when it only matter that you're at 15 and not 5psi.
* __[Battery Tender USB Converter](http://amzn.to/2gHr5qt)__<br>
  This lets me charge my phone from my battery tender terminals. Unless you've
  installed a dedicated USB port, this is a great way to be able to charge a
  phone, flashlight or GPS from your bikes battery.
* __[Neiko Mini Ratcheting Screwdriver](http://amzn.to/2ze8zRR)__<br>
  I like these little screwdrivers. They are compact and easy to use. They
  aren't ideal for reaching a couple of screws deep in the bike, but for
  adjustments on handlebars or tending to GPS mounts, these are great.
* __[Motion Pro 27mm combo lever](http://amzn.to/2zUhMfc)__<br>
  This is a combination of axle wrench and tire spoon. They are a little stubby,
  so practice changing your tire with them a few times before you carry only
  these with you. It's best to set your front axle torque with a torque wrench,
  then back it off by 1/4 turn. Then use this wrench to turn it back 1/4 turn.
  This will let you get the feel for the proper torque and how it feels with
  this wrench.
* __[Motion Pro 22mm combo lever](http://amzn.to/2zUIMeH)__<br>
  This is a tire iron that can be used with the rear axle.
* __[Motion Pro 27mm socket adapter](http://amzn.to/2gJFxhN)__<br>
  This is an adapter that drives a 3/8 socket with the 27mm axle wrench. This is
  a fantastic little tool that can be used without the wrench at first to
  quickly hand assemble a part and then you snap on the tire iron combo wrench
  to finish tightening the part. This really makes this tool kit complete.
* __[Motion Pro Bead Buddy](http://amzn.to/2gHgonY)__<br>
  Along with two tire irons, you can change almost any tire with one of these.
  This device keeps the far side of the tire bead off the seat and in the center
  groove of the rim so that you have enough tire bead to work with to seat the
  tire. If you have extremely hard to seat tires, it's worth having two of
  these. I've found with my Dunlop 606 that I can seat the tire with just
  one of these and the two levers above.
* __[6" socket extension](http://amzn.to/2ibVKgb)__<br>
  The bulky head of the tire iron adapter makes it hard to get to a couple of
  the 8mm bolts. With this extension you should be able to get to everything,
  in particular doing an oil change if you have a skid plate on the bike.
* __[8, 10, 14, 17 metric sockets](http://amzn.to/2hgFSsY)__<br>
  I bought these individually, but a set is a great way to go. These 4 sizes
  cover nearly all of the maintenance items on the bike.
* __[4 and 5 mm allen keys](http://amzn.to/2gJGUgr)__<br>
  I like the ball end wrenches for general maintenance with the ball end on the
  long arm and a regular end on the short arm. I've converted some of the
  philips head screw on the handlebars over to these as well.

![Axle Wrench Socket Driver](/img/posts/adventure-motorcycle-tools/axle-wrench.jpg)

Above is a photo of the [axle wrench socket driver](http://amzn.to/2gJFxhN). It
is a clever little adapter and saves this compact dual sport tool kit from
having to include a ratchet wrench.

### Not Pictured, but elsewhere in my bag
* __A full spare front tube__<br>
  You can run a folded up front in your rear at low speeds if you have to.
* __Assorted zip ties__
* __[Nitrile Gloves](http://amzn.to/2zUkW2y)__
* __[Toppeak Morph Pump](http://amzn.to/2gK612R)__<br>
  The head of a regular bike pump may have trouble fitting between spokes. This
  pump has an external hose that makes it much easier to deal with a rear tire.
* __[Kershaw Cryo Knife](http://amzn.to/2gKXRXD)__<br>
  This is my favorite little knife. It's cheap enough that I don't worry about
  it, but has nice enough steel that it holds an edge well.
* __Fuses taped to the underside of my saddle__<br>
  I keep some extra fuses for the bike taped under the seat of the bike. It
  keeps them out of a bag where they are beaten up by the tools.
* Sunblock
