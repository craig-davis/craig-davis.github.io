I've recently added a JCR front and rear bumpers to my 1997 Jeep XJ. The bumpers
have front and rear offroad lights, and I've just finished wiring them. I've
chosen to use new old stock fog light switches for them so that I can maintain
a stock appearance. I had to source new fog light pigtails from 
[ebay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/cheepjeepxj). 

My new five switch panel came from [GCT Enterprises](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/gctent)
and has fit really well. I'll show you some details of this install, and I'll
review the panel as well.

I picked up this little set of [wire strippers](https://amzn.to/2xtgOXO) and I
didn't expect much from them, but I've been quite impressed with them. You need
to adjust them a bit so that they don't damage any of the strands, but once they
are adjusted they've made quick work of a lot of electrical work lately.

Soldering with [helping hands](https://amzn.to/2zmjTtW). It's useful to put
some heat shrink tubing over the jaws so that they can't damage small wires.
I do all of my soldering with a [Hakko FX888 Soldering Iron](https://amzn.to/2Dj4fDP) 
and it has made all of my projects so much easier.

Jumper cables so I don't have to cut the factory harness

Illumination from factory orange. Here you can see that I've clipped the orange
wire from the factory plug and extended it. I'm preparing to solder it to
the orange leads from the new fog light pigtails.
