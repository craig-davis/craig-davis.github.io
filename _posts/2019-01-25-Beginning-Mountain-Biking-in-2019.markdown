This winter I've had three friends ask me "Hey, I want to mountain bike, what bike should I buy? What else should I buy?". This post has my honest opinions about gear that I ride with and that I personally know. I won't recommend anything that I don't have experience with.

I believe that the outdoor industry has somehow decided that every new sport you adopt will cost $2k. If you want to ski, $2k. If you want to climb, $2k. If you want to bike, $2k. The list of bike + accessories in this article will be about $2k.

## Buy Local

There is a huge difference in quality between a $800 bike and a $1400 bike. For your first bike, you want to be at the less expensive end of the bikes sold by your *local bike shop*. Buy from a local shop, they'll be your guide, source of local knowledge, and center of your new community.

Buying local helps keep the local bike scene alive and funded. Please don't order bikes online. When you buy your first bike from them they'll assemble it themselves with love and care. When you pick it up, bring them a six pack of a local beer. Give it to them in a brown paper bag. Tell them thank you, and that they should keep it refrigerated. This is tradition.

## Bike Selection

You want good components and a nice bike. I think your first bike should be a hardtail. A hardtail is a bike that has a rigid rear and suspension only for the front wheel. By getting a hardtail instead of a full suspension bike you'll get nicer bike components for the same price point and you'll get a bike that forces you to learn some fundamental skills correctly.

In 2019, there's lots of bike styles - but the right one to start with is a Hardtail Trail bike. Trail bikes tend to be playful and easy to ride bikes with good manners for riding over obstacles and handling technical terrain. In the Pacific Northwest, our wet and rooty year round riding means that having a larger tire is nice too. A 27.5+ (27.5 plus) tire is a great choice. This tire is a newer standard, and it's a little larger in diameter than a traditional mountain bike wheel and the tire on it is a fair bit wider. This also means that the tire can be a little softer and help make up for the fact that you'll be starting out without any rear suspension.

The 27.5+ Hardtail Trail Bike category has some great bikes in it. If you have the opportunity, ride each of them and see if one of them speaks to you. You might be surprised that one of them just feels more natural to you. Each of these bikes can be purchased at several price points. For the most part each of the levels has exactly the same frame and each level up has slightly nicer components. This means that the shifters, brakes, and wheels get nicer as you pay more. Once you cross the line around $1400 the initial performance of all of the components is pretty similar. The nicer components will be lighter and more durable, but you might not notice a lot of difference on day one.

## Test Riding

Test ride the bikes! You might be surprised that one of the bikes just feels right. At the very least you'll start to get an idea of what they feel like.

Ride in large circles, ride in small circles, ride in a figure eight pattern. Pedal really hard and then brake hard. Move your body around on the bike and see how much you can move around on the bike.

## Buying the Bike

Buy local. When you pick up the bike, take the shop a six pack of a local beer in a paper bag. Tell them thank you. When you need help, use the local shop. Ask them about trails, take them more beer occasionally, buy parts and tools from them.

## Potential Upgrades

If you can, you should make sure that the bike comes with tubeless tires and a dropper post.

### Tubeless Tires

Go tubeless if at all possible. It's a bit more hassle up front, but they are far superior. You can run them at lower pressures and have better traction, and they are nearly thorn proof and resist punctures. You might need to buy a special pump if you want to work on them yourself, but I think it's a fantastic upgrade to any bike. At the $1400 price point you may or may not get tubeless tires from the factory. Your local bike shop should be able to make that upgrade. For more information, this [blog post from REI about tubeless tires](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/tubed-vs-tubeless.html) is pretty good.

### Dropper Seat Post

    <figcaption>I have a KS on my favorite bike.</figcaption>
</figure>

A dropper post puts a small lever on your handlebar that can be used to raise and lower your saddle. My first dropper post was a revelation. It allows you to drop your saddle out of the way when you are riding more technical terrain and can help prevent accidents where you might be bucked over over the handlebars. It also puts the saddle into a great position on technical terrain where you can push the bike around with your knees a little more.

Adding a dropper post to a bike is a fantastic upgrade, and I think all modern trail bikes should have one. You'll need one that matches the seat tube size of your bike, so if you order one be careful to get the correct one.

## Pedals

These bikes won't come with pedals. Start with flat pedals.

There are two types of pedals, flats and clipless. Clipless pedals use special shoes that have a cleat on them and attach to the pedals a bit like a ski boot attaches to a ski. They have a lot of advantages, but they aren't great for beginners. Flat pedals are a lot like the ones on your first bike - they are flat.

    <img title="Downhill mountain bike pedal" src="/img/posts/beginning-mountain-biking/pedals-M828.jpg" width="350">

</figure>

Flat pedals do come in various shapes and sizes. Over time, you'll probably find a favorite pair. I've got 4 pairs of my beloved [Shimano M828 pedals](https://amzn.to/2BOg1CP). They've got a nice shape, width for my foot, and they have replaceable pins. They are gently concaved and have a positive feel to them.

When you look at most flat pedals, you'll notice that they have scary looking pins or spikes on them. Don't be afraid of these. They help keep your foot from sliding off the pedal. If the pedal didn't have them you'd occasionally slip your foot off your pedal and scrape your shin on the edge of your pedal. It's likely that you'll occasionally still scrape your shin, but usually the pins will help keep your feet planted in place.

</figure>

When you buy your bike it probably won't come with pedals. Most people have opinions. If you don't have an opinion yet, something like the [Raceface Chester](https://amzn.to/2U19Br7) is a great choice. I don't like that they don't have pins at the center of the pedal, but they won't wear out your shoes as quickly.

## Shoes

If you just want to get started, you can wear your running shoes. But don't. Bike shoes can offer three things - mud resistance, a durable sole that won't be torn up by your pedals, and a stiffer last that will keep your foot planted on the pedal. A softer pair of shoes will let your foot wrap around the pedal a bit, and it's not comfortable and your feet are more likely to slip off the pedal.

</figure>

The [Five Ten Bike Shoes](https://amzn.to/2Npg2lu) are fantastic. They are well built, reasonably priced, and hold up well. I think they are a great first shoe. They shed water and mud fairly well, but certainly are not waterproof. They have a fairly stiff sole, but you can still walk comfortably in them. Their sole has enough texture on the bottom that if you need to walk a section that is slick or that has lots of roots you'll have enough traction to do so safely.

With flat pedals, I ride in Shimano DX shoes, the new version is the [SH-GR900](https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/apparel-accessories/shimano-series-lsg-2019/SH-GR900.html). There's nothing stealthy about them, and they don't go from the trail to the pub very well. But, they cover the inside of your ankle and have been really durable.

## Saddles and Grips

You probably won't have an opinion on these yet. But these are the other two places where you touch your bike, and both are extremely important. I'm in the northwest and prefer lockon grips that use a locking ring to keep the grips from moving. This is becoming the standard in the industry. I prefer the ones from [ODI with Ruffian grips](https://amzn.to/2BMAc45). These are a smaller grip and I prefer them. If you find that you prefer a softer grip you should check out the [Oury Lock On Grips](https://amzn.to/2BLI6uO)

Every person has their own anatomy. Start with whatever saddle is on the bike and go ride. If the saddle doesn't work for you, you should try some others. The shop might even have some loaners. Talk to the shop, they can help you get the bike setup properly to help with any issues you've got. If you have any numbness, tingling, or hot spots you might want to change.

## Helmet

All heads are a little different shape. Try on some helmets and find one that fits. You want two things - good coverage of the back of your head with a mountain bike specific helmet, and a fit that is tight enough that your forehead skin moves a little when you move the helmet. Check out [this video on helmet fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdqC5Vng270).

The [Troy Lee A1](https://amzn.to/2U0U3DJ) is a fantastic helmet. It's generally the kind of helmet you want. It's got good coverage of the sides and back of your head and good brow coverage too. The visor is both stylish and easy to adjust. Mine has held up great. The [Bell Super 3](https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Super-MIPS-Cycling-Helmet/dp/B01MDRQNAX) is a nice helmet too. Try them on and find the one that fits.

## Pads

The style for a while was to wear lots of armor. The pendulum has swung back and most people are only wear knee pads these days. I tend to wear a fairly light set of kneepads. I like the [Troy Lee 5400](https://amzn.to/2TWJiSZ). They don't have any straps, and so getting the right size is key. If you want a heavier pad the [POC VPD](https://amzn.to/2E7wSkG) is burly.

I really never ride without mine, they keep my knees warm, fend off briars and rocks, and generally stay out of my way.

## Gloves

Person preference again - I think that gloves with fewer seams are better. I hate fabric bunching up. With that said, as a beginner you may be falling more often, and you want a glove with some protection. Nobody wants to be picking gravel out of your palms. I wear a pair of [Fox Attack Gloves](https://amzn.to/2EoSslO), but they look a little motocross for some people. [Handup Gloves](https://handupgloves.com/gloves) have some nice gloves with simple palms without seams.

Don't buy gloves with bulky gel pads. Don't buy fingerless gloves.

## Glasses

Wear eye protection whenever you can. I wear sunglasses in the summer, goggles when it's dusty, and safety glasses when it's cloudy or dark. Put a simple pair of glasses from the hardware store in your riding bag. That way you won't worry about scratching them up and losing them.

## Clothing

You'll develop preferences here too. There's something to be said for just going riding and to not worry too much about this. But if you must...

I prefer separate shorts and tights with a chamois. In fact, I prefer bibs. I wear Pearl Izumi or Voler Bibs under a pair of lightweight shorts in the summer, 3/4 length knickers in the spring and fall, and winter riding pants when it's cold. Try on several brands and find the ones that seem to suit your anatomy. You'll find that each manufacturer has different ideas.

I prefer bibs to tights because bibs can't creep down and can be a bit looser around your waist, and it's one less seam on your hips. I hate the way that tights and shorts or pants put two seams around your waist.

For riding jerseys, don't be too fussy at first. I prefer synthetic shirts. I've got some really lightweight button shirts for really hot weather, but I mostly wear short sleeve jerseys without zippers.

## Backpack

There's a trend right now to use fanny packs. I don't like them. I prefer a pack. I like the extra spine protection and I like carrying a little more food and water with me. Dakine and Camelbak both make excellent packs. You should start with one in the 10 liter range, it'll be a small and lightweight pack that allows just enough room for some water, a snack, and basic tools. You'll want a larger pack if you start going on epic and remote rides.

## Tools

Talk to the local shop about the tools you'll need to for the bike that you're purchasing. By those tools and then you should use them to do some of your bike maintenance to get comfortable with them. I never leave home without my [bike tool kit](http://there4.io/2015/06/29/rule-31-essential-bike-tool-kit/).

You'll also want a pump for your tires, but at the beginning you can probably get by with a handheld kind that you'll stash in your pack. I like the Crankbrothers Sterling pump with the small gauge. It's got a nice action, and while I wish the handle was a little more ergonomic, it's really well made. Eventually you'll want a floor pump. If you've upgraded to tubeless tires, you should get the [Joe Blow Tubeless Pump](https://amzn.to/2Eo5nnW). This pump has a large reservoir that can be used to seat a tubeless tire - it's something you usually need a shop air compressor to do.

## Go Ride

In an upcoming post, I'll write some some tips and tricks for riding comfortably. In the meantime, go ride.
