While installing my [Boostwerks Engineering Comp Mount](http://www.boostwerksengineering.com/BWE-Comp-Mount_p_14.html) hidden winch, I found that the stock Jeep Cherokee transmission cooler hard lines interfered with my winch placement. In order to make room for my winch I needed to replace my factory hard lines with flexible braided hose so that I could relocate it. 

I probably could have cut the factory line that was in the way, flared the new ends, and then added a section of rubber hose with clamps. This would have let me relocate only a small part of the line. But, this XJ is a hobby, and so I went all-in and replaced the lines from the transmission to the cooler. In an upcoming post I'll cover adding an additional transmission cooler. This post covers  converting the hard lines to soft lines without making any additional modifications.

## Parts List for Conversion

All of the parts came from [Summit Racing](https://www.summitracing.com/) and I chose their own house brand of hose and fittings. While the [AN standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN_thread) makes various brands compatible at the fitting, I don't think the same is true between the hose and the fitting when assembling hoses. 

In the end, we need two hoses. One that is 7 feet long with 45&deg; fitting on each end for the bottom of the cooler to the front of the transmission, and one that is 5.5 feet long with 90&deg; fittings on each end for the top of cooler and the back of the transmission.

## Howto videos

Before you begin, please watch this video of [how to install PTFE fittings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vYpIaf75UI) and then this one that [includes a pressure testing demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fiVh60EdxY). These videos are the basis for how I made these hoses.

## Making the lines

This was my first time making [PTFE hoses](https://www.summitracing.com/search/product-line/summit-racing-ptfe-hose) and with a little preparation it went well. These PTFE fittings require a brass ferrule that can be a little fiddly, and I didn't have any problems assembling these hoses. If you are worried about making these, you can order [extra ferrules](https://www.summitracing.com/parts/sum-220367) in case you need to re-make a fitting.

![Cutting stainless PTFE hose](/img/posts/xj-transmission-cooler-lines/dremel-cutoff.jpg)
I used a dremel with a cut-off wheel to make the cut. Slide the compression side of the fitting onto the hose making sure that the orientation is correct. The flared bell end should be towards your cut. Wrap the location of the cut with tape. I found that [strapping tape](https://amzn.to/2Y3ubMU) worked best and was thin enough to not cause problems. Put a hose clamp around the hose to prevent fraying and give you a straight reference line and prevent the tube from crushing. Cut with your Dremel.

I tried using a fine tooth hacksaw, a tubing cutter, and a cut-off wheel on my grinder and nothing worked as well as the Dremel. I found it was best to cut through the outer stainless first, and slide it off a bit, and then cut the inner PTFE second. After you are finished, use the tip of a pen to make sure that your inner PTFE tube is round.

![Assembling PTFE fittings](/img/posts/xj-transmission-cooler-lines/ready-for-assembly.jpg)

Once you made the cut you can remove the clamp and the tape. Add the ferrule and then assemble the fitting. I used a set of [aluminum soft jaws](https://www.summitracing.com/parts/acc-v304) on [my vice](https://amzn.to/2NWXi0q) to hold one side of the fitting. I found that I needed to use a 19mm open end wrench to assemble one side of the fitting. Just like regular AN lines, it looks best and is properly seated when the faces align.

![Pressure testing PTFE lines](/img/posts/xj-transmission-cooler-lines/pressure-testing-ptfe-lines.jpg)

Once I assembled my lines, I pressure tested them in water with [a tool from [Fragola](https://www.summitracing.com/parts/fra-900666). It's a sealed cap for one end of your hose, and a cap with a [Schrader valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrader_valve) for the other. You can then add 60 psi to your hose with a regular bike pump and submerge it and watch for bubbles. I found that with my hoses it took some time for the weep holes in the fitting to quit emitting tiny bubbles. My hoses held pressure overnight on my bench as well without any problems.


## Installing transmission adapters

The transmission needs adapters to convert it to use -6 AN fittings. I've got a AW-4 automatic, and I needed two [14mm-1.5 adapters](https://www.summitracing.com/parts/ear-9919dfherl) to convert to using -6AN. The transmission has some other adapters on it, and you can see them below after they were removed.

![AW-4 transmission line adapters](/img/posts/xj-transmission-cooler-lines/transmission-adapters-benchtop.jpg)

You can see in the photo above the [new o-rings](https://www.summitracing.com/parts/ear-176106erl) that I installed on the adapters. I put a little ATF on them before installing them, and I torqued these to 30ft-lbs. 

![Jeep XJ -6AN transmission lines](/img/posts/xj-transmission-cooler-lines/transmission-adapters.jpg)

Once installed, they should look like the photo above.

![With hoses](/img/posts/xj-transmission-cooler-lines/transmission-line-install.jpg)

With the hoses installed, they'll look like this. I've used a 90&deg; fitting in the rear, and a 45&deg; fitting for the front.

## Top of the transmission cooler

The factory transmission cooler is built into the radiator and is on the driver side. We'll need to convert both the inlet and outlet to use -6AN as well.

![Factory cooler line](/img/posts/xj-transmission-cooler-lines/top-cooler-line.jpg)

My factory cooler line was seized and the compression nut would not spin on the hard line. I cut the hard line and removed the whole thing with a 6-point socket. You want to remove the whole adapter and not just the flared fitting.

![Upper adapter installed](/img/posts/xj-transmission-cooler-lines/top-cooler-adapter.jpg)

With the [-6AN to &#8541;-18 inverted flare](https://www.summitracing.com/parts/sum-220667b) installed we can see that we'll need a 90&deg; hose end fitting.

![Line installed](/img/posts/xj-transmission-cooler-lines/top-cooler-install.jpg)

With the line installed, we still have lots of room and good routing options.

## Bottom of the transmission cooler
