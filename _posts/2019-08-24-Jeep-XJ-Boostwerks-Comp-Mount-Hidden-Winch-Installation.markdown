## TLDR

The [Boostwerks Comp Mount][comp-mount] is a hidden winch mount for the Jeep Cherokee with an integrated support for the steering pitman arm. Mine is mounted behind a [JCR Crusader Front Bumper][bumper] and is further braced with [Dirtbound Offroad Frame Tie-Ins Brackets][bumper-bracket].

The mount is well built and installed with only minor modifications to the mount itself. The powdercoat is great, and the overall fit and finish is fantastic with great attention to detail. The integrated steering brace has really improved the highway manners of the Jeep. The winch is working great, and I would absolutely use this solution again for mounting a winch in a Jeep Cherokee.

## The Great Parts

The BWE Comp Mount is a great product, and I really like this option for mounting a winch, and I think this is a great option for carrying a winch in a Jeep Cherokee. The low center of gravity and theft protection is great.

## The Bad Parts

There were a few things that were a hassle and made the final installation take longer than I'd originally planned. I had to relocate my [transmission cooler lines][transmission], and I needed to [replace my worn out motor mounts][motor-mounts]. Relocating the winch contactor box under the hood is also a larger project than I originally expected. The fit was nearly spot on, but I did have to enlarge the holes in the mount a bit to match the sway bar mounting locations in my Jeep. In the writeup below, I'll cover these in more detail.
