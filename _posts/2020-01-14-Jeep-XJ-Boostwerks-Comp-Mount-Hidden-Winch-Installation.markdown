## TLDR

The [Boostwerks Comp Mount][comp-mount] is a hidden winch mount for the Jeep Cherokee with an integrated steering  brace. Mine is mounted behind a [JCR Crusader Front Bumper][bumper] and is further braced with [Dirtbound Offroad Frame Tie-Ins Brackets][bumper-bracket].

The mount is well built and installed with only minor modifications to the mount itself. The powdercoat is great, and the overall fit and finish is fantastic with great attention to detail. The integrated steering brace has really improved the highway manners of the Jeep. The winch is working great, and I would absolutely use this solution again for mounting a winch in a Jeep Cherokee.

## The Great Parts

The [BWE Comp Mount][comp-mount] is a great product, and I really like this option for mounting a winch. I think this is a great option for carrying a winch in a Jeep Cherokee. The fit of the comp mount was spot on. The low center of gravity and theft protection is great.

## The Bad Parts

There were a few things that were a hassle and made the final installation take longer than I'd originally planned. I had to relocate my [transmission cooler lines][transmission], and I needed to [replace my worn out motor mounts][motor-mounts]. Relocating the winch contactor box under the hood is also a larger project than I originally expected. 

## The Finished Installation

Here's a view of my XJ  in my garage with my  freshly  installed [Factory 55 spliced flat link][flat-splicer] and [fairlead][fairlead].

![Boostwerks XJ Comp Mount](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/comp-mount-installed.jpg)

After unpacking everything, I immediately removed the contactor box from my [Warn M8s Winch][m8s] and test  fit  it in  the Comp Mount. In this photo you can see that the  freespool switch is pointing backwards towards the engine. You  can also see the black nylon plastic fairlead that ships with the Comp Mount. You can see the  [spool adapter][spool-adapter] that I later installed to replace the handle. It's  a beautifully  built part from Boostwerks.

![Warn M8000 Synthetic Winch](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/winch-cradle.jpg)


I've included a photo of this because I think  it's worth doing - I chase nearly everything that I can with a tap  as I'm tearing down parts. In this case, the sway  bar bushing  mounting holes have taken a lot of vibration and abuse over the years and I think it's worth  chasing them out to make sure that the installation of  the new parts goes smoothly. In this  photo you can also see that I've added some [POR-15][por15] rust inhibitor paint.

![](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/tapping-sway-bar-holes.jpg)

The comp mount adds a fair bit of bracing to the bumper brackets. It ties them into the front frame rails through the sway bar mounting holes and several other locations. However, I think for cross pulling it makes sense to add additional bracing. I've used the  [bumper  tie  in brackets][bumper-bracket] from [Dirtbound Offroad][dirtbound].  I like that their brackets allow  you to keep the  diagonal bracing that supports the  corners of the front header panel.  The brackets  from JCR don't allow that.  I sanded these and gave them a coat of [wrinkle paint][wrinkle-paint].

## Cutting My Crossmember

This was a part of the job that I was the least excited about - cutting the  front crossmember. I made the  cuts with a grinder and cut-off wheel.  I've started to really  like [the Metal  Max from  Lenox][cutoff]. It's proven  durable and still cuts quickly. I was far too fiddly  with marking this out. The Comp Mount covers this entire area, and so the cuts really only need to open  space for the rope to pass through.  
![Jeep XJ Winch Mount](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/crossmember-cut.jpg)

After making the cuts, I removed all of the rough edges, sanded the entire area, and then applied a coat of [POR-15](por15).

![POR15 Rust Proofing](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/crossmember-painted.jpg)

With the cuts done and  the paint  cured it was time to test fit the Comp  Mount. This mount went in and out a lot while I was getting lines moved, wiring installed, and parts moved around. I cannot imagine doing this without a good floor jack.  During this time, I  didn't have the winch in it's cradle. Keep it light!

![Test fitting  the hidden winch](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/cmount-mount-mockup.jpg)

During this time, I found that the holes that aligned with the sway bar bushing mounts were a little out of place compared to  my Jeep. I'm certain that every Jeep is going to be a little different, and so  this  wasn't  surprising. I marked with a [silver Sharpie Pen][sharpie] and then  filed  by hand to make  some room.

![Comp Mount Modifications](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/comp-mount-holes.jpg)

With all of the bolts  lining up and  test fit, it was finally time to install  the comp mount one more time for final fit. I still have no idea  where this chunk  of wood  came from, but I can't imagine working on my Jeep without it.

## Cutting My Bumper

With my comp mount installed into it's final location, I was able to measure for my  fairlead. I established a horizontal  center line between the top  and bottom of the jack cut outs on the front of  [my bumper][bumper], and then established a vertical center line between those. I checked this center line by measuring between my shackle tabs. An [aluminum yardstick][yardstick] with a magnet is great for this - it'll  stay put while you move around to mark things.

![Measure twice  and cut once](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/fairlead-measuring.jpg)

With careful  measurements made, it  was time to do some  drilling. I first punched the location  for one side of the [Factory 55 fairlead][fairlead]. After punching it and checking the measurements one last time, I drilled a hole for the mounting bolt. I then put  the  fairlead  in place and tightened the bolt. I  carefully measured and made the  fairlead square to the bumper, and  then used a center punch to  mark the location of the other  hole. You can  see the  [transfer punch][transfer-punch] in  this following photo. This ensures that the two holes are absolutely spot on without having to measure.  I  think  in this photo  I've also got either magnet or double stick tape holding the  fairlead up  on the free side - I  wanted to be able to  look  at it from a distance to make sure that the spacing looked right.

![Fairlead measuring](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/fairlead-punching.jpg)


With the fairlead in place, I could now address two things - drilling for what I think are anti-theft bolts that insert from the rear, and  then cutting the opening  for the  rope. The anti-theft bolts are inset inside the main bolt holes, and are inline with the center line. They can be carefully measured and  then  drilled.  If  they are off a tiny  bit it  doesn't really matter if you've drilled them a little oversized. 

![Cutting my bumper](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/fairlead-hole-saw.jpg)

The hole for the fairlead was first cut  with  a [2-&frac14; hole  saw][hole-saw]. I  then drew lines between the edges with  my trusty  [silver Sharpie][sharpie] and then cut the bumper with the same [cut  off wheel][cutoff]. 

![Jeep XJ Winch](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/fairlead-lines.jpg)

With  the  cuts made,  it's time  to  clean up the  edges with  a file or [deburring tool](deburring-tool)  and  then painting.  These  areas are completely hidden, and  so I  used [POR15][por15].  

![POR15 Paint on bumper](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/fairlead-paint.jpg)

## Sector Shaft Nut Installation

With that buttoned up,  it was time to move on  to  one last task. The Boostwerks Comp  Mount incorporates a steering  brace. It's a  great design and it puts a burly pillow  bearing onto  the end of the Pitman Arm to prevent the arm from  being able to  wag  around in  open space. The design  replaces the sector shaft nut with a  longer sleeve that engages  the new bearing. In  the photo below you can  see this new sleeve installed.

![Pitman Arm Sector Shaft](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/sector-shaft.jpg)

 In order to torque the sector shaft nut to spec, I needed an extra deep throat 1-&frac14; socket. I purchased the  socket called  for in the instructions, and unfortunately they've changed the manufacturing of  it.  Previous versions had thinner  walls and  could slide completely over the sector shaft to get to the facets. In  the photo below you can  see that the socket that I received had thicker walls and wouldn't  work.  After looking at  my options, and considering just making  it gutentight,  I took  my socket to a  NAPA machine shop. They were able to get it  on a  lathe and into it with a boring bar to reduce the wall thickness.  I dropped off the sector shaft nut and  the socket together and they were able to sort it out for me.

![Sunex extra deep socket](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/socket-problem.jpg)


With my newly machined socket, I was able to torque  the nut to the correct 180ft/lbs.

## Winch Power Cables

[Jeep Cables][cables]  made a beautiful set of custom cables for me. He even labeled each one with custom made labels.  With the winch mounted below and the  contactor box mounted  under the hood, you'll need a custom set of cables. 

![Winch Power Cables](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/winch-positive-wires.jpg)

After mounting  my  winch in the cradle and  the contactor under  the hood on the [Boostwerks Solenoid Mount][solenoid-bracket], I was able to measure for my new cables.  I ordered a full set of cables. They all had 5/8 lug with 5/16 hole.

| Cable | Length |
|---|---|
| F1 | 42 inches |
| F2 | 42 inches |
| A | 42 inches |
| Ground | 52 inches |
| Winch Positive | 18 inches |


With the wires in place, it was almost time to try this thing out!

## Alternator Shield

For what it's worth, I used a plastic from a cheap black plastic garbage can to make a splash shield for my alternator.

![Jeep XJ Alternator Shield](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/alternator-shield.jpg)


## Winch  Rope Guard

After the  winch  was in it's home  one last time,  I  was finally able to  splice the thimble onto my rope. I used the  [Fast Fid][fast-fid], and  it couldn't have been any  easier. They've  got [a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNPt1riHMJ0) on both  repairs and splicing.

![Factor 55 Fast Fid](/img/posts/xj-hidden-winch/small/rope-spliced.jpg)


With  the splice done, it was time to  wind  the winch and go wheeling.

## Winch Clocking for Freespool

I currently have my freespool  selector pointed upwards at an angle. I had the intention of cutting a hole in my front bumper to allow easy  access to it. After getting everything installed, I decided I didn't  want that. For the moment, I just  power-out the rope. The time  the  Jeep is up on stands, I'm going to clock  the selector downwards so that I can get to it from below if I  want to. It'll mean a small hole in the bottom of the mount, and  I'm ok with that.

## Overflow Bottle Relocation

I'm still sorting  out where to locate  my coolant overflow bottle.  The winch contactor took the  location of  the stock tank, and so at the moment  I'm using a Dorman universal tank located in the  space in front  of my brake booster. I built a custom bracket for  it,  and while it's worked well, I'm not sure it's the best solution. I'll write a follow up post once I've decided on  this.
