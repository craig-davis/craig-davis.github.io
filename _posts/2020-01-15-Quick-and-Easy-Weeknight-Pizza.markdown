This pizza started out as [Roberta's Pizza Dough](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/robertas-pizza-dough-52869431). Over the last few years, I've changed it to streamline the assembly and make it as quick as possible for weeknight pizza baking.

Yield: 2 medium sized pizzas

## Preparation

Preheat your over to 475&deg;, with a pizza stone if available.

## Ingredients

Combine the following into the bowl of your mixer. Use a digital scale if possible:

* 200 grams warm water
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp active dry yeast
* 8 grams extra virgin oil
* A few grinds of black pepper
* &mdash; stir &mdash;
* 320 grams King Arthur All Purpose  Flour

The teaspoon measure for the dry ingredients is a little quicker than weighing the dry ingredients.

## Make Piza

Turn on your mixer with the dough hook and give the dough several minutes. If you are in a hurry, you can now make pizza. If you've got the luxury of time you can certainly allow this dough to rise. Frequently, I don't wait. It will be a little more crackery, or maybe a little more flat-bread-ish, but it will still be delicious.

Divide dough in two. Take the first half and give it a few final kneads with some flour, [form into pizza round](https://youtu.be/lz8HlqYn98Q?t=191). Add sauce and topings, bake at 475&deg; for 8-13 minutes depending on your oven.
