[Daniel de Bruin][insta] recently posted a wonderful video about [How to make a STEEL MARBLE TRACK with basic tools][video]. I was impressed with his creativity and the simple tools that he used to build his track. With some time on hands because of the COVID stay at home orders, I decided it'd give it a go.

I'm quite proud of my marble machine roller coaster, but I did stumble a bit sourcing the right parts and adjusting until I found the correct measurements. In this blog post I'll try to add to his HOWTO with a few more details and measurements that should help you along in your project. I'll also include some Amazon Affiliate links to the parts that I purchased and used in my project.

## Jig for Straight Track

In his video he marks out on some press board material and uses clamps to make his straight track pieces. I've got access to a table saw, and so I made a proper jig. I highlight recommend you do the same if you can. You could certainly make one with a hand saw and some patience. 

## Helping Hands

In addition to the jig, having a set of [helping hands][helpinghands] will really speed up your build. When building straight track it's hugely helpful to be able to setup the helping hands to hold the cross brace onto the track in the jig and then hold the solder in one of your hands and the soldering iron in the other. I prefer to keep [heat shrink tubing][heatshrink] over the jaws of my helping hands clamps. It prevents marring surfaces and won't damage wire insulation when you use them on other projectss!

## Bolts Sizes



## Soldering Flux and Solder

In the unstructional video, he uses [Griffon][griffon] products and I did not find them to be generally available here in the US. The [S39 Flux][s39] is listed on their website, but the 99/1 solder may no longer be available. I tried a couple of different options, and found good results with an [Oatey lead free plumbing kit][solder]. This contains a paste flux as well as a copper, bismuth, tin and silver alloy solder with a rosin core. This solder wetted out well and formed strong bonds when the flux was used.

After making a joint, it's best to immediately clean it with a damp cloth to remove the flux residue to prevent tarnishing the wire. I failed to do this on some of my earliest joints and it shows.


## Safety and Fume Extraction

The [lead free solder][solder] that I used it certainly safer than electronics solder with lead. However, metal fumes and flux are still toxic and the fumes need to be handled correctly. The galvanized wire recommended by Daniel also poses a risk, as the zinc in the galvanization can be toxic when heated. Nobody wants to get the [brass chills][fever] and so we should be careful with our lungs even if we're working with lead free materials.

I'm working in a space with an overhead fume extractor and I also use [a small fan][fan] on my workbench. Place the fan next to your work and point it away from you. This way you won't have air blowing on your work and the fumes will tend to be pulled away from you. Watch the smoke from the flux and make sure it's moving away from you! If you are in a workspace with less air flow, I might suggest using a proper [soldering fume absorber][absorber]. 

If you aren't working with gloves, it's best to wash your hands after handling any soldering materials. I know that these are used in plumbing, but wash your hands before handling food.

## Soldering Irons

With soldering irons, you will be rewarded by [having a nicer tool][ironreview]. Higher end models will heat up quicker, maintain a consistent temperature, and will give you better results. In particular, a model with an adjustable temperature can be great for working with various projects. I think that for hobby use there is nothing better than the [Hakko FX888D][solderingiron]. It's a joy to use with high quality parts throughout. I used a chisel tip in it set to 780&deg; F and it worked beautifully. 

If you're just starting out, I'd still stick with Hakko by choosing their temp controlled [FX60101][cheaperiron] or the basic [503F][cheapestiron]. I don't own either of these, but I would expect them both to be able to do this soldering.

## Cutters and Pliers

I prefer the [Knipex diagonal cutters][cutters]. They keep sharp edges, and had no trouble making precise cuts on this galvanied wire. Even making tiny adjustments to make track ends align was easy with them. I did not find any need for the small bolt cutters that he used in the video.

I do have one tool that I'm considering him as a thank you - [a set of parallel jaw pliers][paralleljaw]. This is a tool that you'll wonder how you lived without. Every other set of pliers will only grab wire by one small edge of the tool. These pliers will grip with their entire face and hold securely and strong. They make bending wire at precise positions and to accurate angles quick and easy. As a bonus because of how they open you can pass a wire through the center of the tool to make bends that would otherwise require bent nose needle nose pliers. If you purchase only one extra tool from this blog post, buy these.

## Marble Ball Lift Details

## Motor, Coupler, and Battery Box

I went through a few different motors before I found a suitable one that didn't need any additional gear reduction. This [25RPM 3V DC motor from uxcell] is perfect. It had plenty of torque, didn't bog down, and is quiet. The motor has a 3mm shaft. The galvanized wire measured 1.88mm, and I found that a [3mm to 2mm coupler][coupler] worked great for joining the motor to the central shaft of the ball lift. In some of my photos you'll see an alternate coupler that I used before finding this simpler one.

I used a [battery box with integrated switch][batterybox]. This further simplified the project. I ran the wires underneath the wooden base to hide them. Note that depending on which direction you wrapped your corkscrew lift you might need to reverse the polarity on your motor so that it spins in the correct direction.

I made a simple motor mount out of a small scrap of plywood with a small hole drilled through it. I used a wood screw with a blunted tip as a set screw to keep the motor in place.

## Assembly tips

Make straight track first.
