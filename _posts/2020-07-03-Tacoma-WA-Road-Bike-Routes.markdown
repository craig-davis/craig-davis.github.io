# Tacoma Road Bike Rides

I sometimes feel like we're stuck on this peninsula with poor roads and sketchy drivers. Over the last couple of years I've put together a few go-to rides originating in [Proctor][proctor] but that work well for anyone in [North Tacoma][north].

## Airport Ride
> A quick ride across the bridge and along the airport

This ride feels is an out and back and has three separate legs. Because this ride is not particularly exposed to traffic, it's a great ride for afternoons. Just be alert where it crosses busier roads.

The first leg is a warmup along North 11th Street. This is fairly bike friendly with two way stops protecting side traffic. Keep your eyes open cross Proctor. During high traffic times, I usually dodge through the McLendon Hardware store parking lot and the use the sidewalk to go under the overpass and access the bike path. The second leg goes along the [Scott Pierson Trail][pierson] along Highway 16. You'll jog left at the apparent end of the trail onto Skyline Dr, and then turn right back onto the trail and you'll go through the War Memorial Park. Cross N Jackson Ave and continue on the trail where you'll ride over the Narrows Bridge. This is a great climb and a wonderful part of the ride. Be courteous to the walkers and runners, there will always be some foot traffic.

You can now explore the Gig Harbor side of the bay, and for this quick ride we make an out and back along the airport access road. This road isn't particularly smooth, but it gets very little traffic and is a nice couple of miles to roll along. As a bonus, you could stop at [The Hub][thehub] for pizza and watch some airplanes take off.
