## Business Education for Developers

Technical skills are the backbone of software development. However, in today's world of startups, understanding the broader business landscape is equally vital. A strong grasp of business concepts, such as project management, budgeting, and market analysis, can transform you into a more versatile and effective professional. Having this background enables you to bridge the gap between technical initiatives and business objectives. 

Business vocabulary and viewpoints can help you have smoother communication with non-technical stakeholders. Moreover, a business-oriented perspective can help you make strategic decisions, align software projects with organizational goals, and even explore entrepreneurial opportunities.

With this in mind, I'm sharing a collection of books that I've accumulated over the years. Each of these books was recommended to me by managers and members of leadership at my previous and current employers - there are no sponsorships here.
