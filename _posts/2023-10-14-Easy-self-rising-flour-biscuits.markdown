## Quick biscuits

The secret to these biscuits is the process. The ingredients are simple.

* 450g King Arthur Unbleached Self-Rising Flour
* 1 stick butter (8 tbsp) (regular or unsalted) cold or frozen
* 1 1/3 cup milk
* 1/2 stick butter melted

## The process

1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
1. Weigh 450g self rising flour into a bowl
1. Use a cheese grater to grate the first half of the cold butter into the bowl.
1. Toss the butter shreds in the flour to coat them.
1. Grate the second half of the cold butter into the bowl.
1. Use two knives to further [cut the butter][butter]. You'll use the knives against each other to make the butter bits a little smaller. This is a bit like making pie dough.
1. Add the milk
1. Continue cutting in the butter until the dough is starting to look more uniform.
1. With your hands, gather the dough into a ball and briefly kneed it until the dough comes together. If you are in a very dry climate, you may need to add an additional two to four tablespoons of milk.
1. Roll it with a rolling pin to about 1/2" thick.
1. Cut the dough into quarters and stack them on top of each other.
1. Roll again to 1/2" again, dusting with flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking to your surface.
1. Repeat this process two to three more times. This helps us build thin layers of butter that will make our biscuits flaky and ready for butter and jam. Claire Saffitz gives a great demo of this cutting and stacking in [her miso biscuit video][claire].
1. Use a biscuit cutter to cut your biscuits. 
1. Remove each biscuit round and place onto a baking sheet.
1. Take the remaining dough with the holes and gather it together. Don't make a ball though! Keep it flat so that the layers that we've made are intact. You'll gather into a flat dough by kinda pulling the holes closed. Once it's together, cut the dough into quarters, stack them as before, and roll them again. This keeps our layers organized.
1. Repeats cutting the biscuit rounds and reforming until you've used all of the dough.
1. Use a pastry brush to paint the first half of the melted butter onto the biscuits.
1. Place into the oven at 425°F for 10 minutes.
1. Remove from oven and brush the rest of the butter onto the biscuits.
1. Bake for 3 more minutes. If they aren't as brown as you'd like, add more time.
1. Remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes.
1. Eat them.

We like them with butter and jam, or with scrambled egg and muenster cheese!
