# 4.5" pulley, 94" Belt

I recently blew up a power steering pump in my 1997 Jeep Cherokee. I plan to install a ram with a new steering box soon, and so while installing this pump I also installed a smaller pump pulley. 

[The 4.5" PSC Power Steering Pulleys PP2401][PP2401] is a smaller pulley. This should help with steering at near idle speeds and when rock crawling. This is a press fit pulley with the correct offset for the  6 groove serpentive belt of the Jeep XJ Cherokee. When using this smaller pulley, there isn't enough adjustment available in the belt tensioner to use your stock 95" belt. With this smaller pulley you'll need to install a shorter belt as well.

[Gates Micro-V Serpentine Belt 6 Rib 94 Inch - K060935 (Amazon)][K060935] ([O'Reilly][O-K060935]) is the correct belt to use with the smaller pulley. There is [a good discussion][naxja] of this over at NAXJA.

I'm not a professional. You should check out this video at YouTube: [How to Properly Install a Power Steering Pulley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp7Ozlw29Sg).

**I wish I'd learned this trick a long time ago** - when installing the new pulley, it can be hard to hold it while working on it with the power steering pulley removal and installation tool. Watch the trick in this video: [Tech Video: Power Steering Pump Pulley Installation

The trick is to put 3.5" 5/16 bolts through the pump and then place the heads of the bolts into a vice. You can then gently tighten the pump down to the vice with some washers and bolts. It makes the removal of the old pulley and the installation of the new one MUCH easier.
