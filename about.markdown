I'm a husband, a software engineer, a hobby woodworker, a (sometimes) competitive cyclist. I volunteer with ski and bike patrol and also with search and rescue.

At work, I really enjoy pursuing the craft of development. I worry about cyclomatic complexity and evangelize maintainability and durability. I write a lot of PHP, and it's really not the same as it was 5 years ago.
